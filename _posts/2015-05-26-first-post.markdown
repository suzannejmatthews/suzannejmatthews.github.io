Hello world!

This is my new "technical blog" that I will update with teaching materials, 
technical projects, and other things. Please visit my [website][website]
for detailed information about my professional activities. 
 
The big motivator for this site is my work with the [Parallella][parallella] board. Last 
summer, my department purchased several boards for a pilot parallel computing 
course that was held in Spring 2015. The course was an overall success, but 
through teaching it, I learned quite a bit about the Parallella and produced
quite a few teaching materials associated with it. I thought GitHub would be 
the perfect place for me to share what I have learned and developed with the 
community at large. So, please expect the first set of posts to revolve 
around the Parallella project. Once I get the bulk of my materials out there, 
I'll likely start posting on other topics.

This beautiful theme was designed by [Mark Oleson](http://olesenm.github.io/).
