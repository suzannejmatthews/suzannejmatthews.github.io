Phew! After a bit of effort, I was able to add an external hard drive to 
my parallella cluster, and make it accessible to all the nodes by mounting 
it on a NFS. I've updated [the parallella cluster post][website] to include 
this information. [Visit it here][website] to learn how to set up NFS on your 
parallella cluster too!
