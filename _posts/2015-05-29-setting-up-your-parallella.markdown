The goal of this tutorial is to allow you to set up your Parallella board 
for first use. These instructions are adapted from the [original SD-card guide][sdcard] 
provided on the Parallella website (update: these instructions have been improved
quite a bit since I wrote this tutorial.) This page is based off of the 
[original tutorial][pdf] I wrote in November 2014. 

##What you will need
This tutorial assumes that you bought a Parallella Desktop Edition and have access to a Windows machine. I've
included a list of all the items I purchased for Parallella setup in the table
below:

| Name          | Price         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Parallella Desktop Edition      | 149.00 |
| 8GB MicroSD card w/adapter      | 6.60    | 
| MicroUSB to USB (F) cable | 5.99      | 
| MicroHDMI to USB (F) cable | 2.96      | 
| Crossover cable | 3.99      | 
| **Total** | **191.47**      | 

If you buy the headless edition of the board and plan to SSH remotely into it,
then the only accessory you will need in the above list is the crossover cable.
I bought the Desktop edition because I thought my students would appreciate a 
more 'desktop-like' experience. YMMV.

In addition, make sure you have a Windows laptop with a built in SD reader. If
your laptop doesn't have an SD card reader, you can buy an SD card USB adapter 
for cheap online.

Before you begin the tutorial, please [follow these instructions][heatsink] to properly 
install the heatsink for the board. **Do NOT** attempt to use the board without 
the heatsink!

##Format the SD card
The SD card will be used to house the *operating system* of our Parallella board.  
To set up our system for initial use, we must first install an *image* of our 
desired operating system on it. In essence, an image allows us to get a set of 
desired software onto our system quickly and relatively painlessly. We provide 
the image and all other requisite files for you in the par-master.7z file that
you can [download here][image]. Please be sure to check the Parallella website for 
updated images.

1. From the Web: Download & Install Win32 Disk Imager (you may need to use
admin privileges).
2. Also Download/Install SDFormatter (you may need to use admin privileges)
3. Insert an SD card into SD card reader slot. Use the SD card adapter that came 
with the microSD card.
4. Open the SDFormatter program. Select the drive the SD card is in (usually the F drive). 
**Be absolutely sure that the selected drive is the one associated with the SD card!**
Click `Option`. Set The format type to `FULL (Erase)` and Format size 
adjustment to `ON`. Click `OK`, and then click `Format`. Wait until the 
Formatting procedure is complete. Close the SDFormatter application.
5.Next open the Win32 Disk Imager program. Select the drive the SD card is in 
(usually the F drive). Be absolutely sure that the selected drive is the one 
associated with the SD card!
6. Download the  [file][image] containing the Parallella image to your Desktop and 
extract the files. Using the folder icon in the Win32 Disk Imager program, 
navigate to where you downloaded the image. Click on the `Write` button to 
begin writing the image to the SD card.
7. Once the process is done, it will appear that there is nothing on the 
SD card. *This is fine!*
8. Once you are done, safely eject the SD card and remove the microSD card 
from the adapter. Place the microSD card into the microSD card reader on 
your parallela board. Connect the microUSB adapter to the power USB hub, and 
attach the keyboard and mouse to the hub. Connect the monitorâ€™s HDMI cable to 
the microHDMI cable. Make sure your cable configuration matches the picture 
below. 
9. Boot up the board. Eventually, a login screen should appear. Login in with 
username `linaro` and password `linaro`.

##Expanding the image to fit the disk
This is useful if you have a sd card greater than 8GB. Running 
{% highlight bash %}
df -h
{% endhighlight %}
on the system will show you that only a very small portion of your SD card 
is actually available for use. Essentially, you will need to expand the image 
to fit the entire disk. Open up a terminal and type in the following series 
of commands:
{% highlight bash %}
dmesg | grep "root"
root=/dev/mmcblk0p2  
{% endhighlight %}
`/dev/mmcblk0p2` is your root partition. This is what we want to expand. Type 
this next:
{% highlight bash %}
fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
{% endhighlight %}
Type `m` for help (the m stands for menu). Next, we need to change the
partition table. Let's delete partition 2 (root partition), and then create a 
new partition 2. Type in `d` followed by `2` to delete the root partition. 
Next type in  `n` followed by `p` and `2` to create a new partition 2.
For the first and last sector, choose the default (press enter).
Type `p` to confirm.
Now, write it to disk by pressing `w`.
Reboot the machine by typing 
{% highlight bash %}
sudo shutdown -r now
{% endhighlight %}
Running `df -h` after it comes back up again should show that you now have 
the entire disk available for use.

##Building the Case
The 3D printed case that I provide is specifically designed for the Parallella.
While the Kickstarter gave original backers a case for their Parallella, I'm 
not aware of one for general purchase. I designed [this case][stl] (with the help 
of our department tech Frank Blackmon) last summer for use in my class. 

The case is passively cooled, and neither my students nor I encountered any 
problems with overheating.
If you have a 3D printer, download the [free SolidWorks STL file][stl] and print the 
following case parts:

* 2 base boards
* 4 end connectors

I also suggest you buy 4 little rubber feet (LRFs) and 4 small screw to
actually connect your parallella to the base boards. I provided my students 
a bag with all the case parts at the beginning of the semester with their 
Parallella boards.

Place the 4 end connectors into one of the base boards. Carefully place the 
Parallella board onto the base board (align on the screw holes). Using a non-
magnetic screwdriver, carefully attach the Parallella board to the first 
baseboard. The other base board is the cover.

Place the LRFs underneath the bottom baseboard. We do not recommend that you 
place the LRFs under the connector positions if you plan to use it as part of 
a larger cluster (see followup tutorial). 
 
##Troubleshooting
There are a number of problems you may face during setup. I've compiled a list 
of the most common issues, and ways to rectify them. 

###Nothing comes up! Is my board defective?
Most likely not. My students and I had no issues with our boards. However, 
there are a few things you should check for:

* Ensure that when you attempt to boot the board, you see two LED green 
lights. These should be constantly lit when the board is on. If the LEDs are 
not green or if they are flashing, you may have a power issue, and should
contact Adapteva.
* Ensure that the cables are properly plugged in. Make sure that the microUSB 
cable is plugged in as shown in the image included above. It is absolutely 
crucial that you **NOT** plug anything except a power adapter into the microUSB
port next to the power port! This microUSB port is for power only!
* Next, try and press the `NumLock` key on the keyboard. Does it light up? If so, 
the keyboard is registering. If your screen remains blank, there may be an 
issue with the monitor.

###I tried everything you said above, but it still doesn't work!
If everything above works, and you STILL don't see anything on your monitor 
then you may be having some other issues. The Parallella board is pretty finicky. 
A couple things that I'd suggest checking:

* you need a USB 2.0 compatible power USB hub. In other words, it MUST 
implement the USB 2.0 standard exactly. There are a lot stuff out there that 
may not necessarily work as a USB hub. When I originally bought parts for the 
course I found these really cute 2 port USB splitters. They didn't work -- I was 
so mad. I've gotten other USB splitters to work with my Parallella board, but 
I've noticed things like my screen flickering when I use it. Adapteva strongly 
recommends that you buy a powered USB hub, and I think it's probably a good 
idea to get one, even if it is more expensive.
* Your monitor MUST have a native HDMI port. If you don't you may need a
different monitor. This (embarassingly enough) took me a little bit to figure 
out. So, if you have a VGA monitor, don't expect that an HDMI to VGA adapter 
will do the trick. It will not work. 

If you don't want to buy any of the above materials and don't mind just 
SSHing into your Parallella, take a look at my other tutorial.
