The goal of this tutorial is to allow you to connect to your Parallella board 
from your laptop using an SSH connection. If you donâ€™t have an HDMI monitor, 
 SSH is the the principle way to run programs remotely and transfer files 
between the Parallella board and your computer. This page is based off of the 
[original tutorial][pdf2] I wrote in November 2014. Special thanks to 2LT Zach 
Ramirez and Jim Beck for their help in putting together the initial draft of 
this tutorial.  

## What you will need
This tutorial assumes that you have access to the following things:

* A Parallella Desktop Edition board that is already setup for initial use. 
* A Windows machine with [Putty][putty] installed. If you run OSX or Linux instead, 
you should still be able to follow the majority of this tutorial using the 
`ssh` command. 
* A [crossover][crossover] ethernet cable. Please note that this is *different* from the 
standard CAT5 ethernet cable that you use to connect to the Internet! Crossover 
cables are specifically designed to let you connect two computers directly.
 
## Configuring the Parallella with a static IP
We will first configure our Parallella board with a static IP address. This 
will allow us to connect to the board, even though our Parallella is not 
connected to the Internet. 

* Boot up the Parallella using HDMI display and pull up LXTerminal. 
* Ensure/edit the file `/etc/network/interfaces` so that it contains the 
following lines: 
{% highlight bash %} 
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address 10.0.0.3/8
	up route add 10.0.0.2 dev eth0
{% endhighlight %} 
* Next, edit the file `/etc/hostname` and give your board a new hostname if 
you wish. `linx12345` is an example.
* Edit `\etc\hosts` and add the following line (assuming the IP address and 
hostname matches the above)
{% highlight bash %} 
10.0.0.3 linx12345
{% endhighlight %} 
* Reboot the board using the command `sudo shutdown -r now` to allow the OS 
to process the changes you just made. 

Running `ifconfig` in the terminal when the Parallella comes back up should 
confirm that your board's IP address is now `10.0.0.3`. 

## Configuring your Putty Install
We will now update our Network adapter settings on our Windows machine to 
enable us to use a static IP address when using a crossover cable. 

* Under Control Panel, select `Network and Sharing`->`Change adapter settings`
-> `Local Area Connection`->`Properties`->
`Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)`->`Properties`

* Click on `Alternative Configuration`. Indicate that the IP address should be 
User configured, and enter `10.0.0.2` as your IP address.

* Check `validate settings, if changed, upon exit` and click `OK`. 
* Open up a command prompt on your Desktop (SHIFT->Right Click-> Open Command Windows Here) and ensure that you have an IP address of `10.0.0.2`. If 
you don't, it may be necessary to reboot your machine.

* Connect your Parallella to the laptop using the crossover cable and turn it
on. Ensure that you have connectivity to the board by typing `ping 10.0.0.3` 
into the command window. You should get a series of responses from the board. 

## Connecting to Parallella with Putty
Since Windows does not have built in ssh, we use the Putty program to connect 
to the board using the SSH protocol. 

* Navigate to your Putty install and double-click on `putty.exe`. 
* Create a new profile in Putty that looks like the following:

![](http://suzannejmatthews.com/images/putty.png) 

* Save the profile as Parallella-SSH. Clicking `open` should give you a
login prompt.
* Login using the `linaro` username and `linaro` password. 

If all goes well, you should now be connected to your board! Check out the 
follow up tutorials on learning how to program Epiphany architecture. 

## Using PSFTP to Transfer Files
PSFTP (Putty Secure FTP) is a free client that you can also download from the 
[Putty site][putty] that enables you to securely transfer files between 
computers. PSFTP will acts as an interactive FTP session that allows you to 
list directory contents, browse the file systems, etc. Since my students and I
are not permitted to attach our Parallella boards to our university's network, 
we used PSFTP constantly to transfer files between our laptops and the 
Parallella board.

* Start by navigating to your Desktop and opening a command window. Assuming you 
placed the psftp.exe executable in `C:\Program Files\Putty` type in the
following: `"C:\Program Files\Putty\psftp.exe"` and press `Enter`. This will 
execute the PSFTP program from your Desktop. Why we are doing it this way 
(rather than navigating to the folder and double clicking like we did 
before) will become readily apparent shortly.

* Let's logon to the Parallella using PSFTP. Type `open linaro@10.0.0.3` to 
establish a connection, and type in the username and password.  You should see 
a screen like the one below if everything is successful. Ignore the `no 
hostname specified` message that appears when PSFTP first starts up.

The PSFTP prompt acts like a Linux terminal. You can `ls`, `cd` and execute 
other Linux bash shell commands. In the following set of examples, we will be 
transferring files from the `parallella-files/para-para/src` directory 
and your Desktop.

### Use `get` to transfer files from Parallella to Windows
To transfer files from the Parallella board and place it on the Desktop, we 
will use the `get` command. Doing this from the `Putty` directory under 
`Program Files` may lead to an error, since the folder may be write-protected.
Type the following into the PSFTP prompt:
{% highlight bash %} 
cd parallella-examples/para-para/src
get hello-openmp.c
{% endhighlight %} 
In a few seconds, the `hello-openmp.c` file should appear on your Desktop. A
screenshot from this sesson is shown below:
![](http://suzannejmatthews.com/images/PSFTP_get.PNG) 

### User `put` to transfer files from Windows to Parallella
To transfer files from Windows to the Parallella board, we start in the 
same way as before. Start `psftp` from the Desktop, and logon using 
the command `open linaro@10.0.0.3`. Let's place the file called `data.txt` in 
the the `parallella-examples/para-para/src` directory. Type the following into 
the PSFTP prompt:
{% highlight bash %} 
cd parallella-examples/para-para/src
put data.txt
ls
{% endhighlight %} 
You should see `data.txt` now in the folder. A sample screenshot from this 
session is provided below:

## Troubleshooting
Below are a series of helpful troubleshooting tips organized in Q/A form.

### My Parallella's IP is not `10.0.0.3`!
You may not have followed the above steps to the letter. I believe the image
that I posted should automatically configure your board to the above static 
IP address. In case you chose another image (or for whatever reason, it did not)
check the following:

* Ensure that all the files in the first section match what is specified. In 
particular, `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/hostname` should have the same hostname!
* Run `ifconfig -a` to ensure that the address is `10.0.0.3`

### My Windows machine's IP is not `10.0.0.2`!
Even if you properly followed the instructions for configuring your 
network adapter above, be sure to do the following:

* Ensure that you followed the network configuration settings above exactly.
* Reboot the computer with the network cable connected to a Parallella board 
that is ON. Sometimes, this is what is needed in order for the machine to 
realize that it should use the alternate configuration.
* Try turning off your wireless.  
* Using the `ipconfig` command to ensure that  the IP address is `10.0.0.2`.
* Try the following: prior to turning on the parallella, connect the crossover 
cable to the parallella. Then, turn on the parallella. The network port lights 
should turn on the parallella. Now, check your laptop's IP address. It 
should now be `10.0.0.2`.

### Ok, I *can* connect to my Parallella now, but I can't access the internet!
Yes, this is an issue with this set of instructions. I haven't quite figured 
out how to enable SSH for the Parallella without somehow simultaneously 
disabling your ability to access the internet on your laptop. You may not have 
this problem, but a significant proportion of my students (thought not all) 
did *while* they were using their Parallella.

### Will I be able to connect to the Internet after I'm done using my Parallella?
Once you are done using your Parallella for the day, shut it down using
`sudo shutdown now`, disconnected the crossover cable and reboot your machine.
You should be able to get a wireless internet connection or connect your 
machine via ethernet without having to change any of the settings above.

### I can't seem to transfer files from the Parallella board to my Windows laptop!
Make sure you are following the instructions above for PSFTP. If you are and it 
is still not working, check and make sure you are not trying to write to a 
write protected directory. If the directory is write protected, you will not 
be able to transfer files to it. Transfer the files to a non write-protected 
directory (like the Desktop) instead.

### Files are taking too long to transfer. What should I do?
Some of you may see the program appear to hang when you are transferring 
large files. Use compression such as 7zip to compress the files before 
transfering. This will enable you to transfer larger files more quickly. 
Other than that, be patient!

### Any way to transfer a large number of files at once?
Try creating an archive (use `tar` or place in a folder and zip it up) and 
then try to transfer. Be sure to use compression to make sure that the 
transfer goes as fast as possible.
